# Hats DataPack Minecraft
 This is a data pack that adds 6 hats and 3 accesories to a multiplayer or singleplayer world

when crafting a hat, keep in mind that having two of the same hat, and then trying to wear it will delete the duplicate.
This data pack is only compatible with 1.17 and up versions of Minecraft at the moment. Also, I may or may not update the README with the crafting recipes

To get the best experience use both the data pack and the resource pack together, just download the content of the repository, extract it and inside the new folder are the data pack and resource pack,
then drop the data pack into your data packs folder and the resource pack with your other resource packs
