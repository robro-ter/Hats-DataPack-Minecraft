# Hats DataPack Minecraft
 This is a data pack that adds 6 hats and 3 accesories to a multiplayer or singleplayer world

when crafting a hat, keep in mind that having two of the same hat, and then trying to wear it will delete the duplicate.
This data pack is only compatible with 1.17 and up versions of Minecraft at the moment
